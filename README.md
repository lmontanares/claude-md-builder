# CLAUDE.md Builder

A meta-CLAUDE.md that helps you build other CLAUDE.md files. This IS the working configuration - navigate to this directory in Claude Code and it loads automatically.

## What This Is

**Meta-Builder System**: A CLAUDE.md configuration specialized for creating, analyzing, and optimizing other CLAUDE.md files. It's both the tool and the documentation.

**How It Works**: Navigate to this directory → CLAUDE.md loads → Use natural language commands → Get systematic workflows for CLAUDE.md creation.

## Quick Usage

**Pattern Analysis**: `"analyze this CLAUDE.md"` → Extracts reusable patterns  
**Template Creation**: `"create template for [domain]"` → Generates domain-specific CLAUDE.md  
**Optimization**: `"optimize context usage"` → Token efficiency improvements  
**Validation**: `"validate CLAUDE.md effectiveness"` → Sanity check protocols  

## Navigation Table

| Resource | Purpose | Use When |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Complete meta-builder with all patterns inline | Primary resource for everything |
| **QUICKREF.md** | Essential commands and examples | Need quick reference |
| **examples/** | Complete working CLAUDE.md files | Need full examples |
| **patterns/** | Specialized advanced patterns | Implementing specific features |
| **claude-md-complete-examples.md** | Advanced system templates | Need complex examples |

## User Paths

### New to CLAUDE.md
1. Start with **CLAUDE.md** Core Patterns Library section for basic templates
2. Use `"create simple template"` to practice
3. Explore **examples/** for working configurations

### Building Specific CLAUDE.md
1. Check **QUICKREF.md** for common commands
2. Use patterns from **CLAUDE.md** Core Patterns Library
3. Use `"create template for [your domain]"`

### Advanced Optimization
1. Use `"analyze patterns"` on existing CLAUDE.md files
2. Apply **CLAUDE.md** Context Optimization Rules
3. Implement **CLAUDE.md** Quality Assurance & Validation

### Team Setup
1. Review **CLAUDE.md** Import System and Memory Management sections
2. Set up shared standards with import system
3. Use **CLAUDE.md** Hooks Integration for automation

## Core Capabilities

**5-Parallel-Analysis Workflow**: Systematic pattern extraction from existing CLAUDE.md files  
**Template Generation**: Domain-specific CLAUDE.md creation with best practices  
**Context Optimization**: Token efficiency and performance improvements  
**Import System Integration**: Modular configuration management  
**Hooks System Support**: Automated workflow enforcement  
**Validation Frameworks**: Multi-level effectiveness testing  

## Commands You Can Use Right Now

- `"analyze patterns in [file/example]"`
- `"create template for [web dev/automation/research]"`
- `"optimize this CLAUDE.md for efficiency"`
- `"generate pattern library from examples"`
- `"validate CLAUDE.md effectiveness"`
- `"show import system patterns"`
- `"design command system for [use case]"`

## Technical Note

This is NOT software to install - it's a specialized CLAUDE.md configuration that loads automatically when you navigate to this directory in Claude Code. The patterns and templates are designed for immediate copy-paste usage.
