# CLAUDE.md Good Practices - Educational Guide

*Understanding the principles behind effective CLAUDE.md creation*

## Core Philosophy & Understanding

### CLAUDE.md Supremacy Concept
Understanding **why** CLAUDE.md instructions are treated as immutable system rules while user prompts are flexible requests:

**Adherence Hierarchy Reality:**
- CLAUDE.md instructions are processed as fundamental operational boundaries
- User prompts are interpreted as requests that must work within those boundaries
- This creates predictable, consistent behavior across sessions

**Behavioral Differences to Understand:**
- Process execution: CLAUDE.md steps followed sequentially vs user prompts adapted
- Persistence: CLAUDE.md context maintained throughout session 
- Override behavior: User prompts rarely override CLAUDE.md directives

### Context Window as Training Ground
**Mental Model:** Token limits (~200K) aren't negative constraints but training opportunities for developing skills to efficiently wield larger contexts.

**Skills This Develops:**
- Explicit file selection over random exploration
- Clear task definition and chunking
- Context-sized information organization
- Modular code architecture
- Compact but representative examples
- Precise prompting techniques
- Priority-based information organization

### Main Thread Philosophy
**Key Insight:** With AI agents, the opportunity cost equation changes from `opportunity cost × 1` to `(opportunity cost × 1) + (opportunity cost × N)`.

**Strategic Question:** "What asynchronous process could I have running in the background that could be delivering value?"

**Core Principle:** Do not block the main thread - maximize parallel processing opportunities.

## Structural Design Principles

### Why Modular Design Works
Breaking CLAUDE.md into modules of functionality provides:
- Clear boundaries that prevent instruction bleeding
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better context management
- Reduced cognitive load when reading

### Front-Loading Context Strategy
**Why It's Effective:**
- Higher instruction adherence
- Consistent execution across sessions
- Context persistence throughout interaction
- Reduced context pollution from random file exploration
- Better modular organization

**Trade-off Understanding:** A larger CLAUDE.md with controlled context is often better than unpredictable file exploration that may poison the context.

## Context Management Strategies

### Token Optimization Philosophy
**Strategic Approach:** Strip unnecessary content when analyzing code:
- Remove comments, logging, debug information
- Filter formatting whitespace in large files
- Focus only on functional code structure

**Why This Works:** Maximizes available tokens for actual instruction processing while maintaining code understanding.

### Explicit File Selection Strategy
**Concept:** Deliberately include/exclude specific files based on relevance rather than letting Claude explore randomly.

**Benefits:**
- Predictable context usage
- Controlled information flow
- Reduced risk of context pollution
- Better token efficiency

### Minimum Context Principle
**Goal:** Provide the minimum context necessary to execute the task effectively.

**Why This Matters:**
- Maximizes performance by reducing cognitive load
- Improves token efficiency and reduces costs
- Maintains precision in instruction following
- Enables more complex task execution within limits

## Workflow Integration Understanding

### Task Tool Optimization Insights
**Why Task Tools Are Powerful:** Claude's most effective tool for delegation and parallel processing.

**Strategic Benefits:**
- Enables true parallel execution
- Groups related tasks for token efficiency
- Balances token costs with performance gains
- Allows complex workflow orchestration

### Permission System Trade-offs

**Plan Mode Benefits:**
- Forces consistently formatted responses
- Provides security layer before execution
- Incredibly fast for research and analysis
- Creates compact, structured plans

**Auto-Accept Considerations:**
- Excellent for trusted workflows and repetitive tasks
- Risk: Immediate execution without confirmation
- Best for: Research, large refactoring, following checked plans

**Why AllowedTools > Dangerous Skip:**
- Granular control vs blanket bypass
- Transparent configuration vs hidden runtime flags
- Persistent across sessions vs per-execution
- Auditable configuration vs opaque behavior

## Advanced Techniques Understanding

### Dynamic Memory Concepts
**Philosophy:** Temporarily modify CLAUDE.md for specific contexts, then revert.

**Why This Works:**
- Allows context-specific optimization
- Maintains base configuration integrity
- Enables specialized behavior without permanent changes

**Implementation Strategies:**
- Git versioning for safe experimentation
- File duplication for quick rollback
- Session-based memory refresh techniques

### Context Separation Benefits
**Technique:** Spawn new Claude instances in directories with different CLAUDE.md files.

**Advantages:**
- Cleaner context separation between tasks
- No memory reload issues between contexts
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Reduced context pollution across different workflows

### Performance Optimization Principles
**Strategic Approaches:**
- Use compact examples that demonstrate patterns efficiently
- Priority-based organization (most critical details first)
- Modular refactoring of code for selective reading
- Aggressive filtering of irrelevant details

## Safety & Quality Understanding

### Sanity Check Philosophy
**Why the Name Pattern Works:**
- Quick validation mechanism for CLAUDE.md functionality
- Catches common setup issues immediately
- Provides confidence in instruction adherence
- Simple test that reveals complex problems

**Common Issues It Catches:**
- Forgetting to set a CLAUDE.md
- Wrong folder placement
- Accidental partial deletion
- Filename typos (CLAUSE.md vs CLAUDE.md)
- Context window overflow

### Testing and Validation Approaches

**Instruction Adherence Testing Philosophy:**
- Test priority rules: Do IMPERATIVE instructions get followed without question?
- Command translation: Are natural language commands converted correctly?
- File access: Are restrictions being respected?
- Workflow execution: Do parallel tasks execute as designed?

**Context Window Testing Strategy:**
- Test with progressively larger contexts
- Verify instruction persistence throughout session
- Check for instruction bleed between modules
- Monitor performance degradation points

## Anti-Patterns & Common Mistakes

### CLAUDE.md Creation Mistakes to Avoid
- **Writing guidance instead of rules:** CLAUDE.md should contain specific, actionable instructions, not general suggestions
- **Random file exploration:** Better to explicitly control what Claude reads than let it explore unpredictably
- **Flexible suggestions:** Instructions should be immutable rules, not adaptable guidelines
- **Using CLAUDE.md for documentation:** It's for operational instructions, not explanatory content
- **Forgetting validation:** Always include sanity check mechanisms

### Context Management Mistakes
- **Information dumping:** Including entire codebases without curation wastes tokens
- **"Just in case" content:** Tangential information reduces focus and wastes context
- **Expecting model to filter:** The model performs better with curated, relevant information
- **Vague prompts:** Clear, specific instructions work better than expecting inference

### Permission and Safety Mistakes
- **Over-relying on dangerous skip:** Use AllowedTools for granular control instead
- **Misunderstanding modes:** Plan mode vs auto-accept serve different purposes
- **No backup strategy:** Always plan for safe rollback before modifying CLAUDE.md
- **Poor AllowedTools configuration:** Configure permissions appropriately for task types

### Workflow Integration Mistakes
- **Over-splitting tasks:** Creating tasks that are too small reduces efficiency
- **Missing parallel opportunities:** Not using parallel execution when beneficial
- **Poor token optimization:** Missing opportunities to reduce context usage
- **Under-utilizing Task tools:** Not leveraging delegation capabilities effectively

## Success Indicators & Metrics
